# MannARestaurantPickerEndpoint

Project Description:
A RestaurantPicker application that will take in a cuisine-type as user input and output a random restuarant for the user to try of that category

Instructions:
1. Download the files and put them in their own folder, open the folder in VS Code, and start debugging (F5)
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:5227/RestaurantPicker" for the default output of a random restaurant with all categories (you may need to change the port if it's different on your system > see debug console)
3. Append URL with a cuisine-type such as "http://localhost:5227/RestaurantPicker/Mexican" for random restaurant from taht specific category (Valid options are "Mexican", "Asian", and "Fast-Food")
4. Good eats!

Peer reviewed by Marcel R.: Program ran perfectly, I liked how if you don't include a type of food in the url it'll return one from all three categories. Nice use of arrays and if statements, and the inclusion of .ToLower(). Awesome work! :D
